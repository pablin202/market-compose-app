- Hilt for dependency injection.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle: Dispose observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel: UI related data holder and lifecycle aware. 
  - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Dependency Injection.
